In the age of social media communication, it is easy to modulate  the  minds  of  users  and  also  instigate  violent  actions being taken by them in some cases.There is a need to have a system that can analyze the threat level of tweets from influential users and rank their Twitter  handles  so  that  dangerous  tweets  can  be  avoided going public on Twitter before fact-checking which can hurt the sentiments of people and can take the shape of violence.  
Our aim with this study is to identify and rank extremist twitter users concerning their impact and influence.  We use a technique that takes into consideration both sources based and content-based features of tweets to generate the ranking of the extremist twitter users having a high impact factor.
